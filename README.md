# OutOfMana2
Continuation of the abandoned Out Of Mana (OOM) add-on for World of Warcraft originally created by MrKingSanti

Original abandoned add-on: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/out-of-mana-oom

## Description

Automatically send a chat message and say /oom (emote and voice, works everywhere) to warn your party members when reaching a certain mana percentage. 

This now uses the instance/party/raid chat channel automatically instead of just saying it out-loud and party members missing it.

## Use

Useful for healers to warn tanks and even to yourself when you don't notice that you are running out of mana! :)

This addon is always active so if you are using a non-healer class in an instance you will need to disable it. I will be working on adding in a healer only spec loading option.

## Slash Commands

Type "/mana" in chat to see the current mana limit when the alert activates.

Type "/mana x" to change the current limit percentage, "x" is a number. (/mana 30 to send the alert when 30% mana and so on...).
